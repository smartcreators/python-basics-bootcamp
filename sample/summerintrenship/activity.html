     SELF INTRO

    <P>
        Perhaps you have already listed every job you ever had on your resume. Instead of sharing the same things verbally, be succinct when you talk about your career graph. Your self-introduction for interview requires to include significant positions you held for a long time.
Give a few instances of how you handled challenging situations or dealt with tight deadlines. This is also a good opportunity to give relevant information about your future job responsibilities. For example, you can cite how your weather backup plan came in handy when you were an assistant event planner.
What to remember? Appear confident and let the interviewer know that you understand the job role inside out. Prepare the answers for top interview questions so that you can be ready for what they may ask next.
